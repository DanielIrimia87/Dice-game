## The Dice game is full function game from The Frontend Developer Career Path from Scrimba
## I added my own features/ideas for the game.

- I change the layout of the game
- I added some functionality to the game that allows interacting with the game State like rolling the dice,  the update scores, switching the turn player , checking who won the game and resetting the game.


## GAME RULES ##



- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds;
- In each turn, a player rolls dice. Each result gets added to his score;
- But, if the players rolled a 1, they lose their turn. If they rolled a 6, they double their score.
- The first player to reach 100 points on a GLOBAL score wins the game.
